*web interface for teachers and students in school*

The application needs data from backend to deploy. Which is currently relying on [icanlendar downloaded from the school's officianl website](https://github.com/messizqin/Website-TaylorsCollege/blob/main/calendar/icalexport.ics), however, I found that unprecise with no time relevance. In short words, kowing these informtion about a course will be nice:

* name
* start time
* finish time
* teacher

for better, I'd like to know:

* teacher's email (not **no-reply** craps)
* homework 
* exam schedule
* assignment information
